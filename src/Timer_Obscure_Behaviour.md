# Timer obscure behaviour

:::tip System counter

DIV is just the visible part of the **system counter**.

The **system counter** is constantly incrementing every M-cycle, unless the CPU is in [STOP mode](<#Using the STOP Instruction>).

## Relation between Timer and Divider register

This is a schematic of the circuit involving TAC and DIV:

Notice how the bits themselves are connected to the multiplexer and then to the falling-edge detector; this causes a few odd behaviors:

- Resetting the entire system counter (by writing to `DIV`) can reset the bit currently selected by the multiplexer, thus sending a "Timer tick" and/or "[DIV-APU event](<#DIV-APU>)" pulse early.
- Changing which bit of the system counter is selected (by changing the "Clock select" bits of [`TAC`]) from a bit currently set to another that is currently unset, will send a "Timer tick" pulse.
  (For example: if the system counter is equal to \$3FF0 and `TAC` to \$FC, writing \$05 or \$06 to `TAC` will instantly send a "Timer tick", but \$04 or \$07 won't.)
- On monochrome consoles, disabling the timer if the currently selected bit is set, will send a "Timer tick" once.
  This does not happen on Color models.
- On Color models, a write to `TAC` that fulfills the previous bullet's conditions *and* turns the timer on (it was disabled before) may or may not send a "Timer tick".
  The exact behaviour varies between individual consoles.

## Timer overflow behavior

When `TIMA` overflows, the value from `TMA` is copied, and the timer flag is set in [`IF`], but **one M-cycle later**.
This means that `TIMA` is equal to \$00 for the M-cycle after it overflows.

This only happens when `TIMA` overflows from incrementing, it cannot be made to happen by manually writing to `TIMA`.

Here is an example; `SYS` represents the lower 8 bits of the system counter, and `TAC` is \$FD (timer enabled, bit 1 of `SYS` selected as source):

<figure><figcaption>

`TIMA` overflows on cycle <var>A</var>, but the interrupt is only requested on cycle <var>B</var>:

</figcaption>

M-cycle |    |    ||<var>A</var>|<var>B</var>||&#8203;
--------|----|----|----|--------|----|----|---
`SYS`   | 2B | 2C | 2D |   2E   | 2F | 30 | 31
`TIMA`  | FE | FF | FF | **00** | 23 | 24 | 24
`TMA`   | 23 | 23 | 23 |   23   | 23 | 23 | 23
`IF`    | E0 | E0 | E0 | **E0** | E4 | E4 | E4

</figure>

Here are some unexpected behaviors:

1. Writing to `TIMA` during cycle <var>A</var> acts as if the overflow **didn't happen**!
   `TMA` will not be copied to `TIMA` (the value written will therefore stay), and bit 2 of `IF` will not be set.
   Writing to `DIV`, `TAC`, or other registers won't prevent the `IF` flag from being set or `TIMA` from being reloaded.
2. Writing to `TIMA` during cycle <var>B</var> will be ignored; `TIMA` will be equal to `TMA` at the end of the cycle anyway.
3. Writing to `TMA` during cycle <var>B</var> will have the same value copied to `TIMA` as well, on the same cycle.

Here is how `TIMA` and `TMA` interact:

<details><summary>Explanation of the above behaviors:</summary>

1. Writing to `TIMA` blocks the falling edge from the increment from being detected (see the `AND` gate)[^write_edge].
2. The "Load" signal stays enabled for the entirety of cycle <var>B</var>, and since `TIMA` is made of <abbr title="T-flip-flop with Asynchronous Load">TAL</abbr> cells, it's constantly copying its input.
   However, the "Write to TIMA" signal gets reset in the middle of the cycle, thus the multiplexer emits `TMA`'s value again; in essence, the CPU's write to `TIMA` *does* go through, but it's overwritten right after.
3. As mentioned in the previous bullet point, `TIMA` constantly copies its input, so it updates together with `TMA`.
   This and the previous bullet point can be emulated as if `TMA` was copied to `TIMA` at the very end of the cycle, though this is not quite what's happening in hardware.

[^write_edge]: This is necessary, because otherwise writing a number with bit 7 reset (either from the CPU or from `TMA`) when `TIMA`'s bit 7 is set, would trigger the bit 7 falling edge detector and thus schedule a spurious interrupt.
