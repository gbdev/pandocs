# Undocumented SGB commands

The following information has been extracted from disassembling a SGB1v2
firmware; it should be verified on other SGB revisions.

The SGB firmware explicitly ignores all commands with ID >= $1E. This
leaves undocumented commands $19 to $1D inclusive.

## Stubbed commands

Commands $1A to $1F (inclusive)'s handlers are stubs (only contain an
`RTS`). This is interesting, since the command-processing function
explicitly ignores commands $1E and $1F.

## SGB command 19h

The game _Donkey Kong_ (1994) appears to send this command, and it appears
to set a flag in the SGB's memory. It's not known yet what it does,
though.
