# Interrupt Sources

## INT 40 - VBlank Interrupt

This interrupt is requested every time the Game Boy enters VBlank ([Mode 1](<#FF41 - STAT (LCD Status) (R/W)>)).

The VBlank interrupt occurs ca. 59.7 times a second on a handheld Game
Boy (DMG or CGB) or Game Boy Player and ca. 61.1 times a second on a
Super Game Boy (SGB). This interrupt occurs at the beginning of the
VBlank period (LY=144). During this period video hardware is not using
VRAM so it may be freely accessed. This period lasts approximately 1.1
milliseconds.

## INT 48 - STAT Interrupt

There are various sources which can trigger this interrupt to occur as
described in [STAT register (\$FF41)](<#FF41 - STAT (LCD Status) (R/W)>).

The various STAT interrupt sources (modes 0-2 and LYC=LY) have their 
state (inactive=low and active=high) logically ORed into a shared
"STAT interrupt line" if their respective enable bit is turned on.

A STAT interrupt will be triggered by a rising edge (transition from 
low to high) on the STAT interrupt line.

::: warning

If a STAT interrupt source logically ORs the interrupt line high while 
(or immediately after) it's already set high by another source, then 
there will be no low-to-high transition and so no interrupt will occur. 
This phenomenon is known as "STAT blocking" ([test ROM example](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb/blob/2d52008228557f9e713545e702d5b7aa233d09bb/tests/acceptance/ppu/stat_irq_blocking.s#L21-L22)).

As mentioned in the description of the [STAT register](<#FF41 - STAT (LCD Status) (R/W)>),
the PPU cycles through the different modes in a fixed order. So for 
example, if interrupts are enabled for two consecutive modes such as 
Mode 0 and Mode 1, then no interrupt will trigger for Mode 1 (since 
the STAT interrupt line won't have a chance to go low between them).

### Using the STAT interrupt

One very popular use is to indicate to the user when the video
hardware is about to redraw a given LCD line. This can be useful for
dynamically controlling the SCX/SCY registers ($FF43/$FF42) to [perform
special video effects](https://github.com/BlitterObjectBob/DeadCScroll).

Example application: set LYC to WY, enable LY=LYC interrupt, and have
the handler disable sprites. This can be used if you use the window for
a text box (at the bottom of the screen), and you want sprites to be
hidden by the text box.

## INT 50 - Timer Interrupt

Every time that the timer overflows (that is, when [TIMA](<#FF05 - TIMA - Timer counter (R/W)>) exceeds $FF),
an interrupt is requested by setting bit 2 in the IF register
($FF0F). As soon as that interrupt is enabled, the CPU will execute it by
calling the timer interrupt vector at $0050.

## INT 58 - Serial Interrupt

**XXXXXX\...**

Transmitting and receiving serial data is done simultaneously. The
received data is automatically stored in SB.

The serial I/O port on the Game Boy is a very simple setup and is crude
compared to standard RS-232 (IBM-PC) or RS-485 (Macintosh) serial ports.
There are no start or stop bits.

During a transfer, a byte is shifted in at the same time that a byte is
shifted out. The rate of the shift is determined by whether the clock
source is internal or external. The most significant bit is shifted in
and out first.

When the internal clock is selected, it drives the clock pin on the game
link port and it stays high when not used. During a transfer it will go
low eight times to clock in/out each bit.

The state of the last bit shifted out determines the state of the output
line until another transfer takes place.

If a serial transfer with internal clock is performed and no external
Game Boy is present, a value of \$FF will be received in the transfer.

The following code initiates the process of shifting \$75 out the serial
port and a byte to be shifted into \$FF01:

```rgbasm
   ld a, $75
   ld [$FF01], a
   ld a, $81
   ld [$FF02], a
```

The Game Boy does not support wake-on-LAN. Completion of an externally
clocked serial transfer does not exit STOP mode.

## INT 60 - Joypad Interrupt

The Joypad interrupt is requested when any of [`P1`](<#FF00 - P1/JOYP - Joypad (R/W)>) bits 0-3 change
from High to Low. This happens when a button is
pressed (provided that the action/direction buttons are enabled by
bit 5/4, respectively), however, due to switch bounce, one or more High to Low
transitions are usually produced when pressing a button.

### Using the Joypad Interrupt

This interrupt is useful to identify button presses if we have only selected
either action (bit 5) or direction (bit 4), but not both.
If both are selected and, for example, a bit is already held Low by an action button,
pressing the corresponding direction button would
make no difference. The only meaningful purpose of the Joypad
interrupt would be to terminate the STOP (low power) standby state. GBA SP,
because of the different buttons used, seems to not be affected by
switch bounce.
