# Pixel FIFO

::: tip TERMINOLOGY

All references to a cycle are meant as T-cycles (4.19 MHz) and cycle
counts are doubled on CGB in double speed mode. When it is stated that a
certain action *lengthens mode 3* it means that mode 0 (hblank) is
shortened to make up for the additional time in mode 3, as shown in the following diagram.

## Introduction

FIFO stands for *First In, First Out*. The first pixel to be pushed to the
FIFO is the first pixel to be popped off. In theory that sounds great,
in practice there are a lot of intricacies.

There are two pixel FIFOs. One for background pixels and one for OAM
(sprite) pixels. These two FIFOs are not shared. They are independent
of each other. The two FIFOs are mixed only when popping items. Sprites
take priority unless they're transparent (color 0) which will be
explained in detail later. Each FIFO can hold up to 16 pixels. The FIFO
and Pixel Fetcher work together to ensure that the FIFO always contains
at least 8 pixels at any given time, as 8 pixels are required for the
Pixel Rendering operation to take place. Each FIFO is manipulated only
during mode 3 (pixel transfer).

Each pixel in the FIFO has four properties:
- Color: a value between 0 and 3
- Palette: on CGB a value between 0 and 7 and on DMG this only applies to sprites
- Sprite Priority: on CGB this is the OAM index for the sprite and on DMG this doesn't exist
- Background Priority: holds the value of the [OBJ-to-BG Priority](<#VRAM Sprite Attribute Table (OAM)>) bit

## FIFO Pixel Fetcher

The fetcher fetches a row of 8 background or window pixels and queues
them up to be mixed with sprite pixels. The pixel fetcher has 5 steps.
The first four steps take 2 cycles each and the fifth step is attempted
every cycle until it succeeds. The order of the steps are as follows:

- Get tile
- Get tile data low
- Get tile data high
- Sleep
- Push

### Get Tile

This step determines which background/window tile to fetch pixels from.
By default the tilemap used is the one at $9800 but certain conditions
can change that.

When LCDC.3 is enabled and the X coordinate of the current scanline is
not inside the window then tilemap $9C00 is used.

When LCDC.6 is enabled and the X coordinate of the current scanline is
inside the window then tilemap $9C00 is used.

The fetcher keeps track of which X and Y coordinate of the tile it's on:

If the current tile is a window tile, the X coordinate for the window
tile is used, otherwise the following formula is used to calculate
the X coordinate: ((SCX / 8) + fetcher's X coordinate) & $1F. Because of
this formula, fetcherX can be between 0 and 31.

If the current tile is a window tile, the Y coordinate for the window
tile is used, otherwise the following formula is used to calculate
the Y coordinate: (currentScanline + SCY) & 255. Because of this formula,
fetcherY can be between 0 and 159.

The fetcher's X and Y coordinate can then be used to get the tile from
VRAM. However, if the PPU's access to VRAM is [blocked](<#VRAM Access>)
then the value for the tile is read as $FF.

CGB can access both tile index and the attributes in the same clock
cycle.

### Get Tile Data Low

Check LCDC.4 for which tilemap to use. At this step CGB also needs to
check which VRAM bank to use and check if the tile is flipped vertically.
Once the tilemap, VRAM and vertical flip is calculated the tile data
is retrieved from VRAM. However, if the PPU's access to VRAM is
[blocked](<#VRAM Access>) then the tile data is read as $FF.

The tile data retrieved in this step will be used in the push steps.

### Get Tile Data High

Same as Get Tile Data Low except the tile address is incremented by 1.

The tile data retrieved in this step will be used in the push steps.

This also pushes a row of background/window pixels to the FIFO. This
extra push is not part of the 8 steps, meaning there's 3 total chances to
push pixels to the background FIFO every time the complete fetcher steps
are performed.

### Push

Pushes a row of background/window pixels to the FIFO. Since tiles are 8
pixels wide, a "row" of pixels is 8 pixels from the tile to be rendered
based on the X and Y coordinates calculated in the previous steps.

Pixels are only pushed to the background FIFO if it's empty.

This is where the tile data retrieved in the two Tile Data steps will
come in handy. Depending on if the tile is flipped horizontally the
pixels will be pushed to the background FIFO differently. If the tile
is flipped horizontally the pixels will be pushed LSB first. Otherwise
they will be pushed MSB first.

### Sleep

Do nothing.

### VRAM Access

At various times during PPU operation read access to VRAM is blocked and
the value read is $FF:
- LCD turning off
- At scanline 0 on CGB when not in double speed mode
- When switching from mode 3 to mode 0
- On CGB when searching OAM and index 37 is reached

At various times during PPU operation read access to VRAM is restored:
- At scanline 0 on DMG and CGB when in double speed mode
- On DMG when searching OAM and index 37 is reached
- After switching from mode 2 (oam search) to mode 3 (pixel transfer)

NOTE: These conditions are checked only when entering STOP mode and the
PPU's access to VRAM is always restored upon leaving STOP mode.

## Mode 3 Operation

As stated before the pixel FIFO only operates during mode 3 (pixel
transfer). At the beginning of mode 3 both the background and OAM FIFOs
are cleared.

### The Window

When rendering the window the background FIFO is cleared and the fetcher
is reset to step 1. When WX is 0 and the SCX & 7 > 0 mode 3 is shortened
by 1 cycle.

When the window has already started rendering there is a bug that occurs
when WX is changed mid-scanline. When the value of WX changes after the
window has started rendering and the new value of WX is reached again,
a pixel with color value of 0 and the lowest priority is pushed onto the
background FIFO.

### Sprites

The following is performed for each sprite on the current scanline if
LCDC.1 is enabled (this condition is ignored on CGB) and the X coordinate
of the current scanline has a sprite on it. If those conditions are not
met then sprite fetching is [aborted](<#Sprite Fetch Abortion>).

At this point the [fetcher](<#FIFO Pixel Fetcher>) is advanced one step
until it's at step 5 or until the background FIFO is not empty. Advancing
the fetcher one step here lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle. This process may
be [aborted](<#Sprite Fetch Abortion>) after the fetcher has advanced a
step.

When SCX & 7 > 0 and there is a sprite at X coordinate 0 of the current
scanline then mode 3 is lengthened. The amount of cycles this lengthens
mode 3 by is whatever the lower 3 bits of SCX are. After this penalty is
applied object fetching may be aborted. Note that the timing of the
penalty is not confirmed. It may happen before or after waiting for the
fetcher. More research needs to be done.

After checking for sprites at X coordinate 0 the fetcher is advanced two
steps. The first advancement lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle and the second
advancement lengthens mode 3 by 3 cycles. After each fetcher advancement
there is a chance for a sprite fetch abortion to occur.

The lower address for the row of pixels of the target object tile is now
retrieved and lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle. Once the address is retrieved
this is the last chance for sprite fetch abortion to occur. Exiting
object fetch lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle. The upper address for the
target object tile is now retrieved and does not shorten mode 3.

At this point [VRAM Access](<#VRAM Access>) is checked for the lower and
upper addresses for the target object. Before any mixing is done, if the
OAM FIFO doesn't have at least 8 pixels in it then transparent pixels
with the lowest priority are pushed onto the OAM FIFO. Once this is done
each pixel of the target object row is checked. On CGB, horizontal flip
is checked here. If the target object pixel is not white and the pixel in
the OAM FIFO *is* white, or if the pixel in the OAM FIFO has higher
priority than the target object's pixel, then the pixel in the OAM FIFO
is replaced with the target object's properties.

Now it's time to [render a pixel](<#Pixel Rendering>)! The same process
described in Sprite Fetch Abortion is performed: a pixel is rendered and
the fetcher is advanced one step. This advancement lengthens mode 3 by 1
cycle if the X coordinate of the current scanline is not 160. If the X
coordinate is 160 the PPU stops processing sprites (because they won't be
visible).

Everything in this section is repeated for every sprite on the current
scanline unless it was decided that fetching should be aborted or the
X coordinate is 160.

### Pixel Rendering

This is where the background FIFO and OAM FIFO are mixed. There are
conditions where either a background pixel or a sprite pixel will have
display priority.

If there are pixels in the background and OAM FIFOs then a pixel is
popped off each. If the OAM pixel is not transparent and LCDC.1 is
enabled then the OAM pixel's background priority property is used if it's
the same or higher priority as the background pixel's background priority.

Pixels won't be pushed to the LCD if there is nothing in the background
FIFO or the current pixel is pixel 160 or greater.

If LCDC.0 is disabled then the background is disabled on DMG and the
background pixel won't have priority on CGB. When the background pixel
is disabled the pixel color value will be 0, otherwise the color value
will be whatever color pixel was popped off the background FIFO. When the
pixel popped off the background FIFO has a color value other than 0 and
it has priority then the sprite pixel will be discarded.

At this point, on DMG, the color of the pixel is retrieved from the BGP
register and pushed to the LCD. On CGB when [palette access](<#CGB Palette Access>)
is blocked a black pixel is pushed to the LCD.

When a sprite pixel has priority the color value is retrieved from the
popped pixel from the OAM FIFO. On DMG the color for the pixel is
retrieved from either the OBP1 or OBP0 register depending on the pixel's
palette property. If the palette property is 1 then OBP1 is used,
otherwise OBP0 is used. The pixel is then pushed to the LCD. On CGB when
palette access is blocked a black pixel is pushed to the LCD.

The pixel is then finally pushed to the LCD.

### CGB Palette Access

At various times during PPU operation read access to the CGB palette is
blocked and a black pixel pushed to the LCD when rendering pixels:
- LCD turning off
- First HBlank of the frame
- When searching OAM and index 37 is reached
- After switching from mode 2 (oam search) to mode 3 (pixel transfer)
- When entering HBlank (mode 0) and not in double speed mode, blocked 2 cycles later no matter what

At various times during PPU operation read access to the CGB palette is
restored and pixels are pushed to the LCD normally when rendering pixels:
- At the end of mode 2 (oam search)
- For only 2 cycles when entering HBlank (mode 0) and in double speed mode

::: warning Note

These conditions are checked only when entering STOP mode and the
PPU's access to CGB palettes is always restored upon leaving STOP mode.

### Sprite Fetch Abortion

Sprite fetching may be aborted if LCDC.1 is disabled while the PPU is
fetching an object from OAM. This abortion lengthens mode 3 by the amount
of cycles the previous instruction took plus the residual cycles left for
the PPU to process. When OAM fetching is aborted a pixel is [rendered](<#Pixel Rendering>),
the [fetcher](<#FIFO Pixel Fetcher>) is advanced one step. This advancement
lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle if the current pixel is not 160. If the
current pixel is 160 the PPU stops processing sprites because they won't
be visible.
