# `halt`

`halt` is an instruction that pauses the CPU (during which less power is
consumed) when executed. The CPU wakes up as soon as an interrupt is pending,
that is, when the bitwise AND of [`IE`](<#FFFF — IE: Interrupt enable>)
and [`IF`](<#FF0F — IF: Interrupt flag>) is non-zero.

Most commonly, [`IME`](<#IME: Interrupt master enable flag \[write only\]>) is
set. In this case, the CPU simply wakes up, and before executing the instruction
after the `halt`, the [interrupt handler is called](<#Interrupt Handling>)
normally.

If `IME` is *not* set, there are two distinct cases, depending on whether an
interrupt is pending as the `halt` instruction is first executed.

- If no interrupt is pending, `halt` executes as normal, and the CPU resumes
  regular execution as soon as an interrupt becomes pending. However, since
  `IME`=0, the interrupt is not handled.
- If an interrupt is pending, `halt` immediately exits, as expected, however
  the "`halt` bug", explained below, is triggered.

## `halt` bug

When a `halt` instruction is executed with `IME = 0` and `[IE] & [IF] != 0`, the `halt` instruction ends immediately, but [`pc` fails to be normally incremented](https://github.com/nitro2k01/little-things-gb/tree/main/double-halt-cancel).

Under most circumstances, this causes the byte after the `halt` to be read a second time (and this behaviour can repeat if said byte executes another `halt` instruction).
But, if the `halt` is immediately followed by a jump to elsewhere, then the behaviour will be slightly different; this is possible in only one of two ways:

- The `halt` comes immediately after a `ei` instruction (whose effect is typically delayed by one instruction, hence `IME` still being zero for the `halt`): the interrupt is serviced and the handler called, but the interrupt returns to the `halt`, which is executed again, and thus
waits for another interrupt.
([Source](https://github.com/LIJI32/SameSuite/blob/master/interrupt/ei_delay_halt.asm))
- The `halt` is immediately followed by a `rst` instruction: the `rst` instruction's return address will point at the `rst` itself, instead of the byte after it.
  Notably, a `ret` would return to the `rst` an execute it again.

If the bugged `halt` is preceded by a `ei` and followed by a `rst`, the former "wins".
