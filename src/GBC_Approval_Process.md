# GBC Approval Process

Game Boy Color hardware applies automatic colorization to monochrome
games, with one 4-color palette for backgrounds and two 3-color
palettes for objects (sprites).
Because of past under-utilization of Super Game Boy
features even in first-party games (as explained in an article by
Christine Love), Nintendo required Game Boy Color games to appear
more colorful than this automatic colorization. Thus, Nintendo
required publishers to keep Nintendo in the loop at three points in
development.  The Mario Club division evaluated games on whether
color was being used appropriately.  Some things Mario Club looked at
were variety of colors, both within a scene and between scenes; choice
of colors appropriate to a game's art style, such as objects being
distinguishable and trees being colored like trees; and contrast
between foreground and background to emphasize color saturation.

For both original and ported games, the initial written game design
document needed to explain and illustrate how color would be used, as
well as a project schedule, estimated ROM and RAM size, and whether
the ROM was dual compatible or GBC-only.  Ports of a monochrome game
(such as _Tetris DX_, _Link's Awakening DX_, or ICOM's _MacVenture_
series) to Game Boy Color were subject to concept pre-approval,
unlike original games.  A port's proposal needed to explain what new
gameplay content (other than just colorization) it would include,
such as levels, characters, or items.

At 50 percent milestone and near completion, the publisher would
submit a ROM image to Mario Club for feedback on use of color and
other aspects of game design.
