# Accessing VRAM and OAM

::: warning

When the PPU is drawing the screen it is directly reading
from Video Memory (VRAM) and from the Sprite Attribute Table (OAM).
During these periods the Game Boy CPU may not access VRAM and OAM.
That means that any attempts to write to VRAM or OAM are ignored (data
remains unchanged). And any attempts to read from VRAM or OAM will return
undefined data (typically $FF).

For this reason the program should verify if VRAM/OAM is accessible
before actually reading or writing to it. This is usually done by
reading the Mode bits from the STAT Register (FF41). When doing this (as
described in the examples below) you should take care that no interrupts
occur between the wait loops and the following memory access - the
memory is guaranteed to be accessible only for a few cycles just
after the wait loops have completed.

:::

## VRAM (memory area at $8000-$9FFF) is accessible during Modes 0-2

```
Mode 0 - HBlank Period,
Mode 1 - VBlank Period, and
Mode 2 - Searching OAM Period
```

A typical procedure that waits for accessibility of VRAM would be:

```rgbasm
    ld   hl, $FF41     ; STAT Register
.wait
    bit  1, [hl]       ; Wait until Mode is 0 or 1
    jr   nz, .wait
```

Even if the procedure gets executed at the *end* of Mode 0 or 1, it is
still safe to assume that VRAM can be accessed for a few more cycles
because in either case the following period is Mode 2, which allows
access to VRAM also. However, be careful about STAT interrupts or
other interrupts that could cause the PPU to be back in Mode 3 by the
time it returns. In CGB Mode an alternate method to write data to VRAM
is to use the HDMA Function (FF51-FF55).

If you do not require any STAT interrupts, another way to synchronize to the
start of Mode 0 is to disable all the individual STAT interrupts except Mode 0
(STAT bit 3), enable STAT interrupts (IE bit 1), disable IME (by executing `di`),
and use the `halt` instruction. This allows
use of the entire Mode 0 on one line and Mode 2 on the following line,
which sum to 165 to 288 dots. For comparison, at single speed (4 dots
per machine cycle), a copy from stack that takes
9 cycles per 2 bytes can push 8 bytes (half a tile) in 144 dots, which
fits within the worst case timing for mode 0+2.

## OAM (memory area at $FE00-$FE9F) is accessible during Modes 0-1

```
Mode 0 - HBlank Period
Mode 1 - VBlank Period
```

During those modes, OAM can be accessed directly or by doing a DMA
transfer (FF46). Outside those modes, DMA out-prioritizes the PPU in
accessing OAM, and the PPU will read $FF from OAM during that time.

A typical
procedure that waits for accessibility of OAM would be:

```rgbasm
    ld   hl, $FF41    ; STAT Register
    ; Wait until Mode is -NOT- 0 or 1
.waitNotBlank
    bit  1, [hl]
    jr   z, .waitNotBlank
    ; Wait until Mode 0 or 1 -BEGINS- (but we know that Mode 0 is what will begin)
.waitBlank
    bit  1, [hl]
    jr   nz, .waitBlank
```

The two wait loops ensure that Mode 0 (and Mode 1 if we are at the end
of a frame) will last for a few clock
cycles after completion of the procedure. If we need to wait for the VBlank period, it would be
better to skip the whole procedure, and use a STAT interrupt instead. In any case,
doing a DMA transfer is more efficient than writing to OAM directly.

::: tip NOTE

While the display is disabled, both VRAM and OAM are accessible.
The downside is that the screen is blank (white) during this
period, so disabling the display would be recommended only during
initialization.
