# Pan Docs

> The single, most comprehensive technical reference to Game Boy available to the public.

Go to https://gbdev.io/pandocs/ to read the document.

## Contributing 

[This](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbdev/issues/153) is the RFC proposing the change. You're welcome to discuss the development of this project in the Issues and in our various community channels found [here](https://gbdev.io/chat.html).

Contributing is really easy, fork this repo and edit the files in the **src** directory. Then, you can send your PR.

To deploy Pan Docs locally:

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook#readme), and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads).
  mdBook powers the book itself, Rust is used for some custom plugins and Python scripts are used to render some images.
2. [Install](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#requirements-files) the Python prerequisites (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)
   If you're doing that in a Python virtual environment, be sure to activate it in the shell that will run the `mdbook` commands.
3. Clone this repository and run `mdBook` in the root folder
```bash
# Produce a build
mdbook build
# Watch your files and trigger a build automatically whenever you modify a file.
mdbook watch
# Watches the book's src directory for changes, rebuild the book, serve it on localhost:3000 and refresh clients for each change.
mdbook serve
```
4. The final HTML files are in `docs/pandocs/`.


Be aware of the following caveats:

- `docs/html/` contains only partially processed files and it's also the folder that gets served by `mdbook serve`, so you will see some unprocessed custom markup if you visit the endpoint exposed by mdbook's development web server.
As a workaround, you can manually serve the file in the `docs/pandocs/` with any web server (e.g. you can just run `npx http-server` in the `docs/pandocs` folder).

- `mdbook watch` and `mdbook serve` do *not* watch for changes to files in the `theme/` or `custom/` directories (e.g. highlight.js builds, CSS style overrides). You must trigger the build by either restarting the command, or manually changing one of the watched files.

### Special markup

Pan Docs uses a custom mdBook preprocessor & renderer to enable some special markup:

#### Custom Containers 

Those mimick Vuepress' [custom containers](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#custom-containers)) functionality.

```markdown
  ::: type HEADING

  Content

  :::
```

These are rendered as "info boxes".

- `type` must be `tip`, or `warning`.
- `HEADING` can contain spaces and can be omitted entirely.
- Both `:::` lines **must** be surrounded by empty lines, otherwise they won't be processed.

E.g.

```markdown
::: tip SCOPE

The information here is targeted at homebrew development.
Emulator developers may be also interested in the [Game Boy: Complete Technical Reference](https://gekkio.fi/files/gb-docs/gbctr.pdf) document.

:::
```

will render as

<img src=".github/example_container.png"></img>

#### Internal links

```markdown
[VRAM Sprite Attribute Table (OAM)](<#VRAM Sprite Attribute Table (OAM)>)
```

Since Pan Docs contains a lot of internal references, and getting the actual anchor is somewhat tedious, internal links are given special treatment. Links whose URL simply begins with a hash are eligible; the rest of the (pseudo-)URL is treated as a section name (as plain text), and the link made to point to that section.

Note that the angle brackets [are only required if there are spaces in the URL](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#example-485).

In effect, this means that linking to a section is as simple as copy-pasting its name in the URL field, prepending a `#`, and wrapping everything in `<>` if the name contains a space.

### Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is provided within the browser, courtesy of [`highlight.js`](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js).
[RGBASM syntax](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/rgbasm.5) is highlighted via [a plugin](https://github.com/gbdev/highlightjs-rgbasm), but this requires a custom build of `highlight.js`.

Steps:

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories) `highlight.js` anywhere, and go into that directory.

   You will probably want to target a specific version by checking out its tag.
2. Run `npm install` to install its dependencies.
3. Within the `extras/` directory, clone `highlightjs-rgbasm`; ensure the directory is called `rgbasm`, otherwise the build tool won't pick it up.
4. You can work on and make modifications to `highlightjs-rgbasm`!
5. To make the custom build of `highlight.js`, within the `highlight.js` directory, run `node tools/build.js -t browser <languages>...`, with `<languages>...` being the list of languages to enable support for.
  The languages identifiers are the same that you would use for highlighting (` ```rgbasm `, for example).
6. Copy `build/highlight.min.js` as `theme/highlight.js` in Pan Docs' source.
  Alternatively, for debugging, you can use `build/highlight.js` for a non-minified version, but please don't commit that.

E.g.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:highlightjs/highlight.js.git
$ cd highlight.js
$ git checkout 10.7.2
$ npm install
$ git clone git@github.com:gbdev/highlightjs-rgbasm.git extra/rgbasm
$ node tools/build.js -t browser rgbasm c
$ cp build/highlight.min.js ../pandocs/theme/highlight.js
```
