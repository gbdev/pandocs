# Pan Docs

> ### The single, most comprehensive technical reference to Game Boy available to the public.


**WIP NOTICE**: This is a community effort to give this document a new form. Everything is still work in progress and you're welcome to [contribute](#contributing).

## History

Pan Docs - also known as `GAMEBOY.TXT` or `GBSPEC.TXT` - is an old document dating back to early 1995 originally written by *Pan of Anthrox*. It has been one of most important reference for Game Boy hackers, emulators and homebrew developers during the last 25 years.

  <i>ADDRESS1.PCX, one of the diagrams attached to the first version, released January 28th, 1995</i>
</p>

After its release, it received a number of revisions, corrections and updates, mantaining its TXT format. This [folder](historical/) provides an historical archive of those versions.

In 2008, a wikified version (using Martin Korth's 2001 revision as baseline) has been published. The document has been split in different articles and it continued being mantained and updated in that form.

In 2020, we want to make this repository the new home of this resource, where it can receive new public discussions and contributions, mantain its legacy and historical relevance, while making use of recent tools to be visualized and distributed.
