### Registers

```
 16bit Hi   Lo   Name/Function
 AF    A    -    Accumulator & Flags
 BC    B    C    BC
 DE    D    E    DE
 HL    H    L    HL
 SP    -    -    Stack Pointer
 PC    -    -    Program Counter/Pointer
```

As shown above, most registers can be accessed either as one 16bit
register, or as two separate 8bit registers.

### The Flag Register (lower 8bit of AF register)

```
 Bit  Name  Set Clr  Expl.
 7    zf    Z   NZ   Zero Flag
 6    n     -   -    Add/Sub-Flag (BCD)
 5    h     -   -    Half Carry Flag (BCD)
 4    cy    C   NC   Carry Flag
 3-0  -     -   -    Not used (always zero)
```

Conatins the result from the recent instruction which has affected
flags.

### The Zero Flag (Z)

This bit becomes set (1) if the result of an operation has been zero
(0). Used for conditional jumps.

### The Carry Flag (C, or Cy)

Becomes set when the result of an addition became bigger than FFh (8bit)
or FFFFh (16bit). Or when the result of a subtraction or Comparison
became less than zero (much as for Z80 and 80x86 CPUs, but unlike as for
65XX and ARM CPUs). Also the flag becomes set when a rotate/shift
operation has shifted-out a \"1\"-bit. Used for conditional jumps, and
for instructions such like ADC, SBC, RL, RLA, etc.

### The BCD Flags (N, H)

These flags are (rarely) used for the DAA instruction only, N Indicates
whether the previous instruction has been an addition or subtraction,
and H indicates carry for lower 4bits of the result, also for DAA, the C
flag must indicate carry for upper 8bits. After adding/subtracting two
BCD numbers, DAA is intended to convert the result into BCD format; BCD
numbers are ranged from 00h to 99h rather than 00h to FFh. Because C and
H flags must contain carry-outs for each digit, DAA cannot be used for
16bit operations (which have 4 digits), or for INC/DEC operations (which
do not affect C-flag).
