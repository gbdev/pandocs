It can map up to 64 Mbits (8 MBytes) of ROM.

MBC5 (Memory Bank Controller 5) is the 4th generation MBC. There
apparently was no MBC4, presumably because of the superstition about the
number 4 in Japanese culture. It is the first MBC that is guaranteed to
work properly with GBC double speed mode.

### 0000-3FFF - ROM Bank 00 (Read Only)

Same as for MBC1.

### 4000-7FFF - ROM Bank 00-1FF (Read Only)

Same as for MBC1, except that accessing up to bank 1E0h is supported
now. Also, bank 0 is actually bank 0.

### A000-BFFF - RAM Bank 00-0F, if any (Read/Write)

Same as for MBC1, except RAM sizes are 64kbit, 256kbit and 1mbit.

### 0000-1FFF - RAM Enable (Write Only)

Mostly the same as for MBC1, a value of 0Ah will enable reading and
writing to external RAM. A value of 00h will disable it.

### 2000-2FFF - Low 8 bits of ROM Bank Number (Write Only)

The lower 8 bits of the ROM bank number goes here. Writing 0 will indeed
give bank 0 on MBC5, unlike other MBCs.

### 3000-3FFF - High bit of ROM Bank Number (Write Only)

The 9th bit of the ROM bank number goes here.

### 4000-5FFF - RAM Bank Number (Write Only)

As for the MBC1s RAM Banking Mode, writing a value in range for 00h-0Fh
maps the corresponding external RAM Bank (if any) into memory at
A000-BFFF.
