Processor
---------

  The GameBoy uses a computer chip similar to an Intel 8080.
 It contains all of the instructions of an 8080 except there
 are no exchange instructions. In many ways the processor is
 more similar to the Zilog Z80 processor. Compared to the
 Z80, some instructions have been added and some have been
 taken away.

 The following are added instructions:

  ADD  SP,nn             ;nn = signed byte
  LD  (HLI),A            ;Write A to (HL) and increment HL
  LD  (HLD),A            ;Write A to (HL) and decrement HL
  LD  A,(HLI)            ;Write (HL) to A and increment HL
  LD  A,(HLD)            ;Write (HL) to A and decrement HL
  LD  A,($FF00+nn)
  LD  A,($FF00+C)
  LD  ($FF00+nn),A
  LD  ($FF00+C),A
  LD  (nnnn),SP
  LD  HL,SP+nn           ;nn = signed byte
  STOP                   ;Stop processor & screen until button press
  SWAP r                 ;Swap high & low nibbles of r

 The following instructions have been removed:

  Any command that uses the IX or IY registers.
  All IN/OUT instructions.
  All exchange instructions.
  All commands prefixed by ED (except remapped RETI).
  All conditional jumps/calls/rets on parity/overflow and sign flag.

 The following instructions have different opcodes:

  LD  A,[nnnn]
  LD  [nnnn],A
  RETI

Echo of 8kB Internal RAM
------------------------

 The addresses E000-FE00 appear to access the internal RAM
the same as C000-DE00. (i.e. If you write a byte to address
E000 it will appear at C000 and E000. Similarly, writing a
byte to C000 will appear at C000 and E000.)


User I/O
--------

 There are no empty spaces in the memory map for
implementing input ports except the switchable RAM bank
area (not an option on the Super Smart Card since it's
RAM bank is always enabled).

 An output only port may be implemented anywhere between
A000-FDFF. If implemented in a RAM area care should be
taken to use an area of RAM not used for anything else.
(FE00 and above can't be used because the CPU doesn't
generate an external /WR for these locations.)

 If you have a cart with an MBC1, a ROM 4Mbit or smaller,
and a RAM 8Kbyte or smaller (or no RAM) then you can use
pins 6 & 7 of the MBC1 for 2 digital output pins for
whatever purpose you wish. To use them you must first
put the MBC1 into 4MbitROM/32KbyteRAM mode by writing
01 to 6000. The two least significant bits you write
to 4000 will then be output to these pins.

           the result. (GameBoy ignores this value.)


Cartridge Types
---------------

The following define the byte at cart location 0147:

 ROM ONLY
  This is a 32kB (256kb) ROM and occupies 0000-7FFF.

 MBC1 (Memory Bank Controller 1)
   MBC1 has two different maximum memory modes:
  16Mbit ROM/8KByte RAM  or  4Mbit ROM/32KByte RAM.

   The MBC1 defaults to 16Mbit ROM/8KByte RAM mode
  on power up. Writing a value (XXXXXXXS - X = Don't
  care, S = Memory model select) into 6000-7FFF area
  will select the memory model to use. S = 0 selects
  16/8 mode. S = 1 selects 4/32 mode.

   Writing a value (XXXBBBBB - X = Don't cares, B =
  bank select bits) into 2000-3FFF area will select an
  appropriate ROM bank at 4000-7FFF. Values of 0 and 1
  do the same thing and point to ROM bank 1. Rom bank 0
  is not accessible from 4000-7FFF and can only be read
  from 0000-3FFF.

  If memory model is set to 4/32:
    Writing a value (XXXXXXBB - X = Don't care, B =
   bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area will select an
   appropriate RAM bank at A000-C000. Before you can
   read or write to a RAM bank you have to enable it by
   writing a XXXX1010 into 0000-1FFF area*. To disable
   RAM bank operations write any value but XXXX1010
   into 0000-1FFF area. Disabling a RAM bank probably
   protects that bank from false writes during power
   down of the GameBoy. (NOTE: Nintendo suggests values
   $0A to enable and $00 to disable RAM bank!!)

  If memory model is set to 16/8 mode:
    Writing a value (XXXXXXBB - X = Don't care, B =
   bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area will set the
   two most significant ROM address lines.

  * NOTE: The Super Smart Card doesn't require this
   operation because it's RAM bank is ALWAYS enabled.
   Include this operation anyway to allow your code
   to work with both.

 MBC2 (Memory Bank Controller 2):
   This memory controller works much like the MBC1
  controller with the following exceptions:

   MBC2 will work with ROM sizes up to 2Mbit.

   Writing a value (XXXXBBBB - X = Don't cares, B =
  bank select bits) into 2100-21FF area will select an
  appropriate ROM bank at 4000-7FFF.

   RAM switching is not provided. Unlike the MBC1 which
  uses external RAM, MBC2 has 512 x 4 bits of RAM which
  is in the controller itself. It still requires an
  external battery to save data during power-off though.

   The least significant bit of the upper address byte
  must be zero to enable/disable cart RAM. For example
  the following addresses can be used to enable/disable
  cart RAM:
  0000-00FF, 0200-02FF, 0400-04FF, ..., 1E00-1EFF.
  The suggested address range to use for MBC2 ram
  enable/disable is 0000-00FF.

   The least significant bit of the upper address byte
  must be one to select a ROM bank. For example the
  following addresses can be used to select a ROM bank:
  2100-21FF, 2300-23FF, 2500-25FF, ..., 3F00-3FFF.
  The suggested address range to use for MBC2 rom
  bank selection is 2100-21FF.

 MBC3 (Memory Bank Controller 3):
   This controller is similar to MBC1 except it accesses
  all 16mbits of ROM without requiring any writes to the
  4000-5FFF area.
    Writing a value (XBBBBBBB - X = Don't care, B =
  bank select bits) into 2000-3FFF area will select an
  appropriate ROM bank at 4000-7FFF.

   Also, this MBC has a built-in battery-backed Real
  Time Clock (RTC) not found in any other MBC. Some
  MBC3 carts do not support it (WarioLand II non-color
  version) but some do (Harvest Moon/Japanese version.)

 MBC5 (Memory Bank Controller 5):
   This controller is the first MBC that is guaranteed
  to run in GameBoy Color double-speed mode but it
  appears the other MBC's run fine in GBC double-speed
  mode as well.

   It is similar to the MBC3 (but no RTC) but can
  access up to 64mbits of ROM and up to 1mbit of RAM.
  The lower 8 bits of the 9-bit rom bank select is
  written to the 2000-2FFF area while the upper bit
  is written to the least significant bit of the
  3000-3FFF area.

    Writing a value (XXXXBBBB - X = Don't care, B =
  bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area will select an
  appropriate RAM bank at A000-BFFF if the cart
  contains RAM. Ram sizes are 64kbit,256kbit, & 1mbit.

   Also, this is the first MBC that allows rom bank 0
  to appear in the 4000-7FFF range by writing $000
  to the rom bank select.

 Rumble Carts:
   Rumble carts use an MBC5 memory bank controller.
  Rumble carts can only have up to 256kbits of RAM.
  The highest RAM address line that allows 1mbit of
  RAM on MBC5 non-rumble carts is used as the motor
  on/off for the rumble cart.

    Writing a value (XXXXMBBB - X = Don't care, M =
  motor, B = bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area
  will select an appropriate RAM bank at A000-BFFF
  if the cart contains RAM. RAM sizes are 64kbit or
  256kbits. To turn the rumble motor on set M = 1,
  M = 0 turns it off.

 HuC1 (Memory Bank / Infrared Controller):
   This controller made by Hudson Soft appears to be
  very similar to an MBC1 with the main difference
  being that it supports infrared LED input / output.
  The Japanese cart "Fighting Phoenix" (internal cart
  name: SUPER B DAMAN) is known to contain this chip.

 Bung Carts:
   The flash carts sold by Bung (http://www.bung.com.hk)
  on power up appear like an MBC5 cart except that
  writing $00 to the bank select register selects rom
  bank 1 instead of rom bank 0. Writing values to
  3000-3FFF area does nothing.

   Writing values (XXXXXXXS - X = Don't care, S = Select)
  to 6000-7FFF area selects MBC1 16/8 mode if S=0
  except that writes to 3000-3FFF area still do nothing.
  If S=1 then MBC5 mode is selected. (S=1 by default
  on power up.)

   Cart locations A000 & A100 act as special
  write only hardware control registers if a
  value of $c0 is written to 0000-1FFF area.
  These hardware control registers are used
  for setting up cart hardware for different
  games when the Bung cart is used as a Multicart
  for holding several different games.


Power Up Sequence
-----------------

  When the GameBoy is powered up, a 256 byte program
 starting at memory location 0 is executed. This program
 is located in a ROM inside the GameBoy. The first thing
 the program does is read the cartridge locations from
 $104 to $133 and place this graphic of a Nintendo logo
 on the screen at the top. This image is then scrolled
 until it is in the middle of the screen. Two musical
 notes are then played on the internal speaker. Again,
 the cartridge locations $104 to $133 are read but this
 time they are compared with a table in the internal rom.
 If any byte fails to compare, then the GameBoy stops
 comparing bytes and simply halts all operations.

 GB & GB Pocket:
      Next, the GameBoy starts adding all of the bytes
      in the cartridge from $134 to $14d. A value of 25
      decimal is added to this total. If the least
      significant byte of the result is a not a zero,
      then the GameBoy will stop doing anything.

 Super GB:
      Even though the GB & GBP check the memory locations
      from $134 to $14d, the SGB doesn't.

  If the above checks pass then the internal ROM is
 disabled and cartridge program execution begins at
 location $100 with the following register values:

   AF=$01-GB/SGB, $FF-GBP, $11-GBC
   F =$B0
   B =$00-GB/SGB/GBP/GBC, $01-GBA
   C =$13
   DE=$00D8
   HL=$014D
   Stack Pointer=$FFFE
   [$FF05] = $00   ; TIMA
   [$FF06] = $00   ; TMA
   [$FF07] = $00   ; TAC
   [$FF10] = $80   ; NR10
   [$FF11] = $BF   ; NR11
   [$FF12] = $F3   ; NR12
   [$FF14] = $BF   ; NR14
   [$FF16] = $3F   ; NR21
   [$FF17] = $00   ; NR22
   [$FF19] = $BF   ; NR24
   [$FF1A] = $7F   ; NR30
   [$FF1B] = $FF   ; NR31
   [$FF1C] = $9F   ; NR32
   [$FF1E] = $BF   ; NR33
   [$FF20] = $FF   ; NR41
   [$FF21] = $00   ; NR42
   [$FF22] = $00   ; NR43
   [$FF23] = $BF   ; NR30
   [$FF24] = $77   ; NR50
   [$FF25] = $F3   ; NR51
   [$FF26] = $F1-GB, $F0-SGB ; NR52
   [$FF40] = $91   ; LCDC
   [$FF42] = $00   ; SCY
   [$FF43] = $00   ; SCX
   [$FF45] = $00   ; LYC
   [$FF47] = $FC   ; BGP
   [$FF48] = $FF   ; OBP0
   [$FF49] = $FF   ; OBP1
   [$FF4A] = $00   ; WY
   [$FF4B] = $00   ; WX
   [$FFFF] = $00   ; IE

 It is not a good idea to assume the above values
will always exist. A later version GameBoy could
contain different values than these at reset.
Always set these registers on reset rather than
assume they are as above.

 Please note that GameBoy internal RAM on power up
contains random data. All of the GameBoy emulators
tend to set all RAM to value $00 on entry.

 Cart RAM the first time it is accessed on a real
GameBoy contains random data. It will only contain
known data if the GameBoy code initializes it to
some value.

Stop Mode
---------

  The STOP command halts the GameBoy processor
 and screen until any button is pressed. The GB
 and GBP screen goes white with a single dark
 horizontal line. The GBC screen goes black.


Low-Power Mode
--------------

  It is recommended that the HALT instruction be used
 whenever possible to reduce power consumption & extend
 the life of the batteries. This command stops the
 system clock reducing the power consumption of both
 the CPU and ROM.

  The CPU will remain suspended until an interrupt
 occurs at which point the interrupt is serviced and
 then the instruction immediately following the HALT
 is executed. If interrupts are disabled (DI) then
 halt doesn't suspend operation but it does cause
 the program counter to stop counting for one
 instruction on the GB,GBP, and SGB as mentioned below.

  Depending on how much CPU time is required by a game,
 the HALT instruction can extend battery life anywhere
 from 5 to 50% or possibly more.

 WARNING: The instruction immediately following the
  HALT instruction is "skipped" when interrupts are
  disabled (DI) on the GB,GBP, and SGB. As a result,
  always put a NOP after the HALT instruction. This
  instruction skipping doesn't occur when interrupts
  are enabled (EI).
   This "skipping" does not seem to occur on the

  (assuming interrupts disabled for all examples)

1) This code causes the 'a' register to be incremented TWICE.
      76          halt
      3C          inc  a

2) The next example is a bit more difficult. The following code
      76          halt
      FA 34 12    ld   a,(1234)

   is effectively executed as

      76          halt
      FA FA 34    ld   a,(34FA)
      12          ld   (de),a

3) Finally an interesting side effect
      76          halt
      76          halt

    This combination hangs the cpu.
   The first HALT causes the second HALT to be repeated, which
   therefore causes the following command (=itself) to be
   repeated - again and again.
   Placing a NOP between the two halts would cause the NOP to
   be repeated once, the second HALT wouldn't lock the cpu.

  Below is suggested code for GameBoy programs:

Video
-----

  The main GameBoy screen buffer (background) consists
 of 256x256 pixels or 32x32 tiles (8x8 pixels each). Only
 160x144 pixels can be displayed on the screen. Registers
 SCROLLX and SCROLLY hold the coordinates of background to
 be displayed in the left upper corner of the screen.
 Background wraps around the screen (i.e. when part of it
 goes off the screen, it appears on the opposite side.)

  An area of VRAM known as Background Tile Map contains
 the numbers of tiles to be displayed. It is organized as
 32 rows of 32 bytes each. Each byte contains a number of
 a tile to be displayed. Tile patterns are taken from the
 Tile Data Table located either at $8000-8FFF or
 $8800-97FF. In the first case, patterns are numbered with
 unsigned numbers from 0 to 255 (i.e. pattern #0 lies at
 address $8000). In the second case, patterns have signed
 numbers from -128 to 127 (i.e. pattern #0 lies at address
 $9000). The Tile Data Table address for the background
 can be selected by setting the LCDC register.

  There are two different Background Tile Maps. One is
 located from $9800-9Bff. The other from $9C00-9FFF.
 Only one of these can be viewed at any one time. The
 currently displayed background can be selected by
 setting the LCDC register.

  Besides background, there is also a "window" overlaying
 the background. The window is not scrollable i.e. it is
 always displayed starting from its left upper corner. The
 location of a window on the screen can be adjusted via
 WNDPOSX and WNDPOSY registers. Screen coordinates of the
 top left corner of a window are WNDPOSX-7,WNDPOSY. The
 tile numbers for the window are stored in the Tile Data
 Table. None of the windows tiles are ever transparent.
 Both the Background and the window share the same Tile
 Data Table.

  Both background and window can be disabled or enabled
 separately via bits in the LCDC register.

  If the window is used and a scan line interrupt disables
 it (either by writing to LCDC or by setting WX > 166)
 and a scan line interrupt a little later on enables it
 then the window will resume appearing on the screen at the
 exact position of the window where it left off earlier.
 This way, even if there are only 16 lines of useful graphics
 in the window, you could display the first 8 lines at the
 top of the screen and the next 8 lines at the bottom if
 you wanted to do so.

  WX may be changed during a scan line interrupt (to either
 cause a graphic distortion effect or to disable the window
 (WX>166) ) but changes to WY are not dynamic and won't
 be noticed until the next screen redraw.

  The tile images are stored in the Tile Pattern Tables.
 Each 8x8 image occupies 16 bytes, where each 2 bytes
 represent a line:

  Tile:                                     Image:

                                           00000000 -> $00

  As it was said before, there are two Tile Pattern Tables
 at $8000-8FFF and at $8800-97FF. The first one can be used
 for sprites, the background, and the window display. Its
 tiles are numbered from 0 to 255. The second table can be
 used for the background and the window display and its tiles
 are numbered from -128 to 127.


Sprites
------

  GameBoy video controller can display up to 40 sprites
 either in 8x8 or in 8x16 pixels. Because of a limitation
 of hardware, only ten sprites can be displayed per scan
 line. Sprite patterns have the same format as tiles, but
 they are taken from the Sprite Pattern Table located at
 $8000-8FFF and have unsigned numbering. Sprite
 attributes reside in the Sprite Attribute Table (OAM
 - Object Attribute Memory) at $FE00-FE9F. OAM is divided
 into 40 4-byte blocks each of which corresponds to a sprite.

  In 8x16 sprite mode, the least significant bit of the
 sprite pattern number is ignored and treated as 0.

  When sprites with different x coordinate values overlap,
 the one with the smaller x coordinate (closer to the left)
 will have priority and appear above any others.

  When sprites with the same x coordinate values overlap,
 they have priority according to table ordering. (i.e.
 $FE00 - highest, $FE04 - next highest, etc.)

  Please note that Sprite X=0, Y=0 hides a sprite. To
 display a sprite use the following formulas:

 SpriteScreenPositionX(Upper left corner of sprite) = SpriteX - 8
 SpriteScreenPositionY(Upper left corner of sprite) = SpriteY - 16

  To display a sprite in the upper left corner of the
 screen set sprite X=8, Y=16.

  Only 10 sprites can be displayed on any one line.
 When this limit is exceeded, the lower priority sprites
 (priorities listed above) won't be displayed. To keep
 unused sprites from affecting onscreen sprites set their
 Y coordinate to Y=0 or Y=>144+16. Just setting the X
 coordinate to X=0 or X=>160+8 on a sprite will hide it
 but it will still affect other sprites sharing the same
 lines.

 Blocks have the following
 format:

  Byte0  Y position on the screen
  Byte1  X position on the screen
  Byte2  Pattern number 0-255 (Unlike some tile
         numbers, sprite pattern numbers are unsigned.
         LSB is ignored (treated as 0) in 8x16 mode.)
  Byte3  Flags:

         Bit7  Priority
               If this bit is set to 0, sprite is displayed
               on top of background & window. If this bit
               is set to 1, then sprite will be hidden behind
               colors 1, 2, and 3 of the background & window.
               (Sprite only prevails over color 0 of BG & win.)
         Bit6  Y flip
               Sprite pattern is flipped vertically if
               this bit is set to 1.
         Bit5  X flip
               Sprite pattern is flipped horizontally if
               this bit is set to 1.
         Bit4  Palette number
               Sprite colors are taken from OBJ1PAL if
               this bit is set to 1 and from OBJ0PAL
               otherwise.


Sprite RAM Bug
--------------

  There is a flaw in the GameBoy hardware that causes
 trash to be written to OAM RAM if the following commands
 are used while their 16-bit content is in the range
 of $FE00 to $FEFF:

  inc xx     (xx = bc,de, or hl)
  dec xx

  ldi a,(hl)
  ldd a,(hl)

  ldi (hl),a
  ldd (hl),a

  Only sprites 1 & 2 ($FE00 & $FE04) are not affected
 by these instructions.


Sound
-----

  There are two sound channels connected to the output
 terminals SO1 and SO2. There is also a input terminal Vin
 connected to the cartridge. It can be routed to either of
 both output terminals. GameBoy circuitry allows producing
 sound in four different ways:

   Quadrangular wave patterns with sweep and envelope functions.
   Quadrangular wave patterns with envelope functions.
   Voluntary wave patterns from wave RAM.
   White noise with an envelope function.

  These four sounds can be controlled independantly and
 then mixed separately for each of the output terminals.

  Sound registers may be set at all times while producing
 sound.

  When setting the initial value of the envelope and
 restarting the length counter, set the initial flag to 1
 and initialize the data.

  Under the following situations the Sound ON flag is
 reset and the sound output stops:

  1. When the sound output is stopped by the length counter.
  2. When overflow occurs at the addition mode while sweep
     is operating at sound 1.

  When the Sound OFF flag for sound 3 (bit 7 of NR30) is
 set at 0, the cancellation of the OFF mode must be done
 by setting the sound OFF flag to 1. By initializing
 sound 3, it starts it's function.

  When the All Sound OFF flag (bit 7 of NR52) is set to 0,
 the mode registers for sounds 1,2,3, and 4 are reset and
 the sound output stops. (NOTE: The setting of each sounds
 mode register must be done after the All Sound OFF mode
 is cancelled. During the All Sound OFF mode, each sound
 mode register cannot be set.)

  NOTE: DURING THE ALL SOUND OFF MODE, GB POWER CONSUMPTION
 DROPS BY 16% OR MORE! WHILE YOUR PROGRAMS AREN'T USING
 SOUND THEN SET THE ALL SOUND OFF FLAG TO 0. IT DEFAULTS
 TO 1 ON RESET.

  These tend to be the two most important equations in
 converting between Hertz and GB frequency registers:
 (Sounds will have a 2.4% higher frequency on Super GB.)

     gb = 2048 - (131072 / Hz)

     Hz  = 131072 / (2048 - gb)


Timer
-----

  Sometimes it's useful to have a timer that interrupts at
 regular intervals for routines that require periodic or
 percise updates. The timer in the GameBoy has a selectable
 frequency of 4096, 16384, 65536, or 262144 Hertz. This
 frequency increments the Timer Counter (TIMA). When it
 overflows, it generates an interrupt. It is then loaded
 with the contents of Timer Modulo (TMA). The following
 are examples:

 ;This interval timer interrupts 4096 times per second

     ld  a,-1
     ld  ($FF06),a     ;Set TMA to divide clock by 1
     ld  a,4
     ld  ($FF07),a     ;Set clock to 4096 Hertz

 ;This interval timer interrupts 65536 times per second

     ld  a,-4
     ld  ($FF06),a     ;Set TMA to divide clock by 4
     ld  a,5
     ld  ($FF07),a     ;Set clock to 262144 Hertz


Serial I/O
----------

  The serial I/O port on the Gameboy is a very simple setup
 and is crude compared to standard RS-232 (IBM-PC) or RS-485
 (Macintosh) serial ports. There are no start or stop bits
 so the programmer must be more creative when using this port.

  During a transfer, a byte is shifted in at the same time
 that a byte is shifted out. The rate of the shift is deter-
 mined by whether the clock source is internal or external.
 If internal, the bits are shifted out at a rate of 8192Hz
 (122 microseconds) per bit. The most significant bit is
 shifted in and out first.

  When the internal clock is selected, it drives the clock
 pin on the game link port and it stays high when not used.
 During a transfer it will go low eight times to clock
 in/out each bit.

  A programmer initates a serial transfer by setting bit 7
 of $FF02. This bit may be read and is automatically set
 to 0 at the completion of transfer. After this bit is set,
 an interrupt will then occur eight bit clocks later if the
 serial interrupt is enabled.
  If internal clock is selected and serial interrupt is
 enabled, this interrupt occurs 122*8 microseconds later.
  If external clock is selected and serial interrupt is
 enabled, an interrupt will occur eight bit clocks later.

  Initiating a serial transfer with external clock will
 wait forever if no external clock is present. This allows
 a certain amount of synchronization with each serial port.

  The state of the last bit shifted out determines the
 state of the output line until another transfer takes
 place.

  If a serial transfer with internal clock is performed
 and no external GameBoy is present, a value of $FF will
 be received in the transfer.

  The following code causes $75 to be shifted out the
 serial port and a byte to be shifted into $FF01:

    ld   a,$75
    ld  ($FF01),a
    ld   a,$81
    ld  ($FF02),a


Interrupt Procedure
-------------------

  The IME (interrupt master enable) flag is reset by DI and
 prohibits all interrupts. It is set by EI and acknowledges
 the interrupt setting by the IE register.

 1. When an interrupt is generated, the IF flag will be set.
 2. If the IME flag is set & the corresponding IE flag is
    set, the following 3 steps are performed.
 3. Reset the IME flag and prevent all interrupts.
 4. The PC (program counter) is pushed onto the stack.
 5. Jump to the starting address of the interrupt.

  Resetting of the IF register, which was the cause of the
 interrupt, is done by hardware.

  During the interrupt, pushing of registers to be used
 should be performed by the interrupt routine.

  Once the interrupt service is in progress, all the
 interrupts will be prohibited. However, if the IME flag
 and the IE flag are controlled, a number of interrupt
 services can be made possible by nesting.

  Return from an interrupt routine can be performed by
 either RETI or RET instruction.

  The RETI instruction enables interrupts after doing a
 return operation.

  If a RET is used as the final instruction in an interrupt
 routine, interrupts will remain disabled unless a EI was
 used in the interrupt routine or is used at a later time.

  The interrupt will be acknowledged during opcode fetch
 period of each instruction.


Interrupt Descriptions
----------------------

  The following interrupts only occur if they have been
 enabled in the Interrupt Enable register ($FFFF) and
 if the interrupts have actually been enabled using the
 EI instruction.

  V-Blank -

   The V-Blank interrupt occurs ~59.7 times a second
   on a regular GB and ~61.1 times a second on a Super
   GB (SGB). This interrupt occurs at the beginning of
   the V-Blank period. During this period video hardware
   is not using video ram so it may be freely accessed.
   This period lasts approximately 1.1 milliseconds.

  LCDC Status -

   There are various reasons for this interrupt to occur
   as described by the STAT register ($FF40). One very
   popular reason is to indicate to the user when the
   video hardware is about to redraw a given LCD line.
   This can be useful for dynamically controlling the SCX/
   SCY registers ($FF43/$FF42) to perform special video
   effects.

  Timer Overflow -

   This interrupt occurs when the TIMA register ($FF05)
   changes from $FF to $00.

  Serial Transfer Completion -

   This interrupt occurs when a serial transfer has
   completed on the game link port.

  High-to-Low of P10-P13 -

   This interrupt occurs on a transition of any of the
   keypad input lines from high to low. Due to the fact
   that keypad "bounce"* is virtually always present,
   software should expect this interrupt to occur one
   or more times for every button press and one or more
   times for every button release.

   * - Bounce tends to be a side effect of any button
      making or breaking a connection. During these
      periods, it is very common for a small amount of
      oscillation between high & low states to take place.

      about 48.6uS, 2 about 19uS, and 3 about 41uS. This
      is interrupted every 16.6ms by the VBlank (1).

      (Mode 0 is present between 201-207 clks, 2 about
       77-83 clks, and 3 about 169-175 clks. A complete
       cycle through these states takes 456 clks.

   Name     - DMA
   Contents - DMA Transfer and Start Address (W)

   The DMA Transfer (40*28 bit) from internal ROM or RAM
   ($0000-$F19F) to the OAM (address $FE00-$FE9F) can be
   performed. It takes 160 microseconds for the transfer.

   40*28 bit = #140  or #$8C.  As you can see, it only
   transfers $8C bytes of data. OAM data is $A0 bytes
   long, from $0-$9F.

   But if you examine the OAM data you see that 4 bits are
   not in use.

   40*32 bit = #$A0, but since 4 bits for each OAM is not
   used it's 40*28 bit.

   It transfers all the OAM data to OAM RAM.

   The DMA transfer start address can be designated every
   $100 from address $0000-$F100. That means $0000, $0100,
   $0200, $0300....

    As can be seen by looking at register $FF41 Sprite RAM
   ($FE00 - $FE9F) is not always available. A simple routine
   that many games use to write data to Sprite memory is shown
   below. Since it copies data to the sprite RAM at the appro-
   priate times it removes that responsibility from the main
   program.
    All of the memory space, except high ram ($FF80-$FFFE),
   is not accessible during DMA. Because of this, the routine
   below must be copied & executed in high ram. It is usually
   called from a V-blank Interrupt.

Wait:                <- We need to wait 160 microseconds.
      dec a          <-  4 cycles - decrease A by 1
      jr nz,Wait     <- 12 cycles - branch if Not Zero to Wait
      pop af         <- Restore A reg & flags
